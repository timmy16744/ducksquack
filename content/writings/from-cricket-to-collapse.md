There is a peculiar inversion at the heart of Australian public life that I have been struggling to articulate. We reserve our most intense scrutiny for the things that matter least, while the things that matter most proceed largely unexamined.

Consider the Sandpaper affair. For weeks, the nation was consumed by the spectacle of cricketers cheating in a game. Inquiries were held. Careers were ended. The moral fabric of the nation was, we were assured, at stake. Meanwhile, the actual structural conditions of Australian life continued their quiet deterioration, noticed by few and addressed by fewer.

I do not say this to minimise sporting integrity. I say it because the contrast illuminates something about how we allocate our collective attention.

The social contract in this country has become something rather different from what it once was. The mythology of mateship persists in our rhetoric, but the reality has drifted toward something more extractive. A small cohort floats on salaries exceeding six hundred thousand dollars, while the majority experience what can only be described as a contraction in real living standards. Wealth is measured in inflated asset values, yet the lived experience of most Australians grows measurably harder each year.

Our political class is among the best compensated on Earth. The Prime Minister earns approximately six hundred thousand dollars annually. Backbenchers start above two hundred and thirty thousand. These figures exceed what comparable officials earn in nations with far larger economies. I do not begrudge anyone a decent salary, but there is something unsettling about a system where those presiding over national decline are so generously rewarded for their failures.

The only effective correction would be to link political compensation directly to the wellbeing of ordinary citizens. If the bottom half of the population struggles, those at the top should feel the pinch too. This will never happen, of course, but the thought experiment is clarifying.

We sit atop extraordinary natural wealth. One fifth of global lithium reserves. A third of the world's rutile. Iron ore, nickel, copper, rare earths. Yet our approach to this inheritance has been remarkably consistent: dig it up, ship it out raw, then buy back the finished products at a premium. The same pattern repeats in agriculture. Australian beef commands top prices on Shanghai menus while remaining increasingly unaffordable in suburban supermarkets.

Consider the absurdity of our position with coal. We possess some of the world's largest reserves. We export that coal to China. China uses it to power factories that manufacture goods. We then import those goods at substantial markup. The energy that could have powered Australian manufacturing instead powers Chinese manufacturing, and we pay twice: once in the resource extracted, once in the finished product purchased. This is not comparative advantage. This is structural dependence dressed up as economic strategy.

The manufacturing collapse is now nearly complete. We have declined from twenty-eight percent of GDP in the 1960s to less than six percent today, the lowest in the OECD. We rank 102nd globally in economic complexity, between Bangladesh and Senegal. We cannot manufacture an EpiPen. We import ninety percent of our pharmaceuticals and eighty-five percent of our medical devices. When Ford, Holden, and Toyota departed in 2017, they took one hundred and twenty supplier companies with them. The tooling, the institutional knowledge, the trained workforce: dispersed. We do not make things anymore. We dig things up and ship them elsewhere.

I find myself thinking often about Norway. They discovered oil in 1969. Instead of treating it as a windfall to be spent, they established the Government Pension Fund Global. Today it holds roughly 1.7 trillion dollars. That works out to approximately 300,000 dollars for every Norwegian citizen. The fund generates returns sufficient to finance national investment while maintaining some of the highest living standards on Earth.

Australia possesses comparable natural wealth. Our sovereign wealth fund holds 230 billion dollars. That is 8,800 dollars per Australian. Norway built something that would endure. We built a housing bubble and called it prosperity.

The regulatory environment has become something like the umpiring in modern AFL: well-intentioned in theory, suffocating in practice. Starting a mine, an abattoir, or a small business means navigating a bureaucratic labyrinth that defeats all but the most determined or well-resourced applicants. The impulse to add more rules in response to every failure has created a system that prevents things from happening rather than enabling them.

Energy policy represents perhaps the most complete failure of imagination. We possess endless solar exposure and vast stretches of unpopulated desert. We could be the world's leader in photovoltaic deployment, exporting clean energy as readily as we once exported coal. Instead, power prices rise while feed-in tariffs fall. Households with rooftop solar earn pennies per kilowatt-hour while energy retailers post record profits.

And beneath these visible failures lies a quieter vulnerability that few discuss. Our critical digital infrastructure is controlled almost entirely by foreign corporations. When Australian businesses store data in the cloud, that data resides on servers owned by Amazon, Microsoft, or Google—American companies, subject to American law. Our payment systems run on foreign networks. The undersea cables connecting us to the global internet are operated by foreign entities. We have built an economy that cannot function without infrastructure we do not control, and we have done so without any serious national conversation about what that dependence means.

The housing market has inflated beyond any reasonable connection to underlying value. Climate policy remains largely symbolic. Indigenous disadvantage persists despite decades of targets and programmes. The National Broadband Network ranks eighty-third globally. Defence research is starved of funding while procurement contracts flow overseas.

And now, a transformation in artificial intelligence approaches that will reshape every aspect of economic life, with no credible national response in sight.

The consultancy estimates suggest 1.3 million Australian workers will need to transition to new careers by 2030. A third of the workforce faces potential displacement. These projections assume that AI capabilities plateau, that progress continues at a linear pace, that there will be time to adapt. I do not believe these assumptions are sound.

What I observe is capability doubling every few months. The jobs that were supposed to be safe—the knowledge work, the analysis, the skilled professional roles—these are precisely the jobs that artificial intelligence targets most effectively. The junior positions that once trained the next generation of experts are disappearing. Law firms reduce graduate hiring. Accounting practices shrink their entry-level programmes. The cognitive ladder that previous generations climbed is collapsing. The rungs are vanishing faster than people can climb.

Our political class still struggles to understand how the internet works. They are manifestly unprepared for what is coming. The policy response centres on reskilling, as if the challenge were simply a matter of teaching new skills. This fundamentally misunderstands the nature of the disruption. You cannot reskill millions of people for a handful of expert positions, especially when the positions that remain require capabilities that take years to develop.

Our education system compounds the problem. It remains optimised for standardised outcomes and skills that are being automated at an accelerating rate. Memorisation, calculation, routine analysis—these were once valuable. They are becoming commodities. We have no serious national conversation about what education means when the traditional pathways to competence are being dismantled.

I became a father recently. My son Arthur will grow up in this country, and the thought of the world we are preparing for him weighs heavily on me. He will inherit a nation that exports its resources and imports its necessities. A nation whose critical infrastructure is controlled by others. A nation whose political class earns among the highest salaries on Earth while presiding over a quiet unravelling.

The question is not whether Australia can muddle through. It probably can, in some diminished form. The question is whether we are capable of something better.

The raw materials are here. The human capital exists. What seems to be missing is the political will to do anything other than manage decline while protecting the interests of those who benefit from the current arrangements.

My son deserves leaders who are prepared to build for the future rather than maintain monuments to past failures. I suspect most Australians feel something similar. The gap between what we could be and what we are choosing to be grows wider each year.

Whether we find the collective will to close that gap remains, for now, an open question. But the window for asking it does not stay open forever. Some questions, if deferred long enough, answer themselves.
