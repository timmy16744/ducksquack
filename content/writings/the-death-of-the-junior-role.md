There is a question I have been circling for some time, one that seems to me both urgent and strangely under-discussed: how do people become good at things?

The answer, for most of human history, has involved some version of apprenticeship. You begin by doing simple tasks under supervision. You make mistakes in contexts where mistakes are survivable. You watch someone more experienced and absorb, often unconsciously, the tacit knowledge that cannot be written down. Gradually, you take on more responsibility. Eventually, you become the person others learn from. The cycle continues.

This model is so deeply embedded in how we organise work that we rarely examine it. Law firms have junior associates. Hospitals have residents. Accounting practices have graduate programmes. Software companies have junior developers. The entry-level position is not merely a source of cheap labour, though it is certainly that. It is also the mechanism by which expertise propagates across generations.

I have watched this mechanism begin to fail.

In software engineering, the field I know best, the pattern has become unmistakable. Tasks that once occupied junior developers for months, the routine work that built their intuitions, can now be completed by AI systems in minutes. Code review, documentation, basic feature implementation, debugging straightforward issues: these were the training ground. They were also, not coincidentally, the economic justification for hiring someone with limited experience.

The logic is uncomfortable but clear. If an AI can perform junior-level work at a fraction of the cost, why hire a junior? The senior developers, the ones whose judgment and architectural thinking remain valuable, can now leverage AI directly. They become more productive. The organisation becomes leaner. The entry point into the profession quietly disappears.

I have friends in law who describe the same dynamic. The research tasks that once occupied first-year associates, the document review, the case summarisation, the preliminary drafting, these are precisely the tasks that large language models perform well. Firms are reducing junior hiring not because they have become cruel but because the economic rationale for those positions has eroded. The work that justified the salary no longer requires a human.

Accounting follows the same trajectory. Graduate programmes shrink. The routine analysis that trained new professionals migrates to automated systems. The path from qualification to competence narrows and steepens.

I want to be precise about what is being lost. It is not simply jobs, though jobs are certainly being lost. It is the infrastructure of expertise transmission. The junior role was never only about completing tasks. It was about creating the conditions under which someone could become capable of more than tasks. The exposure, the mentorship, the gradual accumulation of judgment: these were byproducts of employment, but they were essential byproducts.

When that infrastructure disappears, where does the next generation of experts come from?

One answer, increasingly common, is that they do not. The senior professionals currently in practice continue until retirement, leveraging AI to extend their productive years. But no one is coming up behind them. The pipeline has been severed. We are consuming accumulated human capital without replenishing it.

Another answer, the one I find more plausible, is that expertise acquisition will transform rather than vanish. But the transformation will be profound, and the burden will shift almost entirely onto the individual.

Consider what this means in practice. A person who wishes to become skilled in software engineering, or law, or accounting, or medicine, will need to construct their own training programme. They will use AI systems as their juniors, delegating routine tasks while attempting to develop the judgment that comes from doing those tasks themselves. They will need to be simultaneously the learner and the architect of their own learning. They will bear the full cost of their development, in time, in resources, in the uncertainty of outcomes.

Some will thrive in this environment. Those with sufficient resources, with strong self-direction, with access to mentors outside formal employment, will find ways to acquire expertise despite the collapse of traditional pathways. They will treat AI as a training tool rather than merely a production tool. They will deliberately slow down, doing work themselves that could be automated, because they understand that the struggle is where learning happens.

But many will not. The autodidact's path has always been available in theory. In practice, most people learn through structured environments with clear expectations and external accountability. When those environments disappear, the limiting factor is not ability but the capacity for self-organisation under conditions of radical uncertainty. That is a rare trait, and there is no evidence that it can be trained into people who do not possess it.

What concerns me is the shape this creates. A small cohort of highly skilled practitioners, trained before the transition or gifted enough to navigate it independently, commanding enormous premiums for their judgment. A vast pool of aspirants, unable to find the footholds that once existed, cycling through credentials that no longer connect to employment. And an expanding middle of AI-assisted mediocrity, where people with surface-level understanding direct systems they cannot fully evaluate.

This is not a labour market problem in the conventional sense. It is an epistemological problem. How do we know what we know? How does expertise accumulate and transmit? What happens to fields when the mechanisms of quality control, which depended on extensive human apprenticeship, no longer function?

I do not think there is an obligation on those who benefited from traditional career ladders to preserve them for the next generation. Obligation is too strong. But I do think there is something worth considering about what we owe to the continuation of knowledge itself.

Passing on knowledge is what makes humans grow. This is not merely a sentiment. It is an observation about how civilisation functions. Each generation inherits not just physical infrastructure but cognitive infrastructure: the skills, the intuitions, the hard-won understanding of how things work. When transmission fails, that infrastructure decays. You can see it in any field where expertise has been lost. The knowledge existed. Then it did not. The transition is rarely dramatic. It simply becomes harder to find someone who knows.

I think about this often in relation to my son. The career paths I might have imagined for him, the stable progressions from education through entry-level positions to mastery, may not exist by the time he reaches working age. If he wishes to become skilled at something, he will likely need to become skilled at learning itself, at constructing his own development in the absence of structures that once did that work.

Perhaps this is not entirely bad. There is something artificial about the credentialed pathway, the way it channels human potential through narrow gates controlled by institutions with their own interests. If AI disrupts that, it may also liberate. People might find more direct routes to contribution, unconstrained by the requirement to spend years in subordinate positions waiting for permission to do meaningful work.

But I suspect the liberation will be unevenly distributed. Those with resources, with networks, with the psychological constitution for self-directed learning, will be liberated. Those without will simply be excluded, left to compete for shrinking pools of routine work that has not yet been automated.

The junior role is dying. What replaces it remains unclear. The optimistic scenario is a transformation in how expertise develops, with AI becoming a training partner rather than just a replacement. The pessimistic scenario is a gradual hollowing out of professional competence, as the mechanisms that produced experts cease to function without anyone quite noticing until the absence becomes acute.

I do not know which scenario will prevail. Perhaps elements of both. What I do know is that the question deserves more attention than it currently receives. We are not merely reorganising work. We are reorganising how human beings become capable of doing work worth doing. The stakes are higher than any quarterly earnings report can capture.

The apprenticeship model evolved over centuries because it worked. We are discarding it in years because the economics have shifted. Whether we have a replacement, or even understand what we are losing, remains to be seen.
