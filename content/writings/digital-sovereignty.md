There is a question I find myself returning to with increasing frequency: where does Australia actually exist in digital terms? Not the landmass, which remains stubbornly physical, but the infrastructure that now underlies nearly every aspect of modern life. Where does it live? Who controls it? And what does it mean that most Australians have never considered these questions?

Let me make the inquiry concrete. When an Australian business stores data in the cloud, that data almost certainly resides on servers owned by Amazon, Microsoft, or Google. These are American companies, subject to American law, operating infrastructure that may be physically located in Australia but is controlled from elsewhere. The data of Australian citizens, Australian businesses, Australian government agencies flows through systems that we do not own and cannot ultimately control.

When Australians communicate, they do so primarily through platforms owned by foreign corporations. The messages, the metadata, the patterns of connection: all of this passes through infrastructure we have no sovereign claim over. The terms of service are written in California. The moderation decisions are made according to priorities that may or may not align with Australian interests. We are tenants in digital spaces owned by others.

Our payment systems depend on foreign networks. Visa, Mastercard, the SWIFT system that enables international transfers: none of these are Australian. If access were restricted, whether through commercial decision or geopolitical pressure, the consequences would be immediate and severe. We have built an economy that cannot function without infrastructure we do not control.

The telecommunications backbone is somewhat better, though not as much as we might assume. The undersea cables that connect Australia to the global internet are critical vulnerabilities. There are not many of them. They land at known locations. They could, in principle, be severed or tapped or redirected. The companies that operate them are mostly foreign. The equipment that powers them is manufactured elsewhere.

I want to be careful here. I am not arguing for paranoia. I am not suggesting that foreign technology companies are actively hostile or that their services should be rejected. Global integration has brought enormous benefits. The platforms and infrastructure I am describing enable commerce, communication, and innovation that would be impossible otherwise. The question is not whether to participate in global digital systems but whether to do so with eyes open about what that participation entails.

The concept of sovereignty has traditionally meant control over territory. A nation is sovereign to the extent that it can determine what happens within its borders without external interference. This remains meaningful, but it is increasingly incomplete. In a world where critical infrastructure is digital, sovereignty must also mean some degree of control over the digital systems on which national life depends.

By this standard, Australia's sovereignty is considerably more limited than most citizens realise.

Consider what would happen in a serious geopolitical crisis. Not a war, necessarily, but a significant deterioration in relations with a major power. The dependencies I have described would become leverage. Access to cloud services could be restricted. Payment networks could be disrupted. Communications platforms could be throttled or monitored or simply turned off. We would discover, very quickly, how much of what we take for granted depends on the continued goodwill of entities we do not control.

This is not hypothetical. We have watched other nations discover these dependencies in real time. We have seen how quickly digital infrastructure can become a vector for coercion. The lesson should be clear: strategic autonomy requires some degree of digital autonomy, and digital autonomy requires infrastructure that is not entirely controlled by others.

The honest assessment is that the horse has largely bolted. The decisions that could have established meaningful digital sovereignty were not made decades ago when they might have mattered. We did not develop domestic cloud infrastructure at scale. We did not build payment systems that could function independently. We did not create the conditions for a technology industry that could provide alternatives to foreign platforms. We integrated enthusiastically into global digital systems without much consideration of what that integration would cost in terms of autonomy.

Reversing this now would be extraordinarily difficult. The network effects that entrench dominant platforms work against any domestic alternative. The capital requirements for building infrastructure at scale exceed what Australian investors have shown willingness to provide. The talent tends to flow toward the established centres of the technology industry, which are not here. We are not starting from a position of strength.

And yet the question remains: what should we do now, given where we are?

I do not think complete digital sovereignty is achievable or even desirable. The costs would be prohibitive. The benefits of global integration are real. Some degree of interdependence is the price of participation in the modern economy. The goal should not be autarky but resilience: the ability to absorb shocks, to maintain essential functions even when external systems are disrupted, to have options when dependencies become liabilities.

This might mean maintaining some domestic capacity in critical areas even when foreign alternatives are cheaper. Redundancy has value that does not appear on balance sheets. It might mean data localisation requirements for certain categories of sensitive information, ensuring that at least some Australian data remains under Australian jurisdiction. It might mean investment in domestic cloud infrastructure, not to replace foreign providers entirely but to ensure alternatives exist.

It might mean taking seriously the question of where critical government systems are hosted and who has access to them. It might mean thinking carefully about the telecommunications equipment that forms the backbone of Australian connectivity, and whether strategic considerations should sometimes override price considerations.

These are not easy questions. There are legitimate arguments on multiple sides. National security concerns can shade into protectionism. Sovereignty can become an excuse for inefficiency. The line between prudent resilience and paranoid isolation is not always clear.

I find myself genuinely uncertain about where that line should be drawn. I can see the case for accepting deep integration and managing the risks through diplomacy and diversification. I can also see the case for more aggressive pursuit of domestic alternatives, even at significant cost. The honest answer is that I do not know which approach is correct, and I am sceptical of anyone who claims certainty.

What I do know is that the question deserves more attention than it receives. We have drifted into digital dependence without much democratic deliberation about whether that dependence serves our interests. The decisions were made, or more often not made, by default rather than design. We woke up one morning to discover that critical national infrastructure was controlled by foreign corporations, and mostly we shrugged and continued scrolling.

My son will inherit whatever digital arrangements we leave him. If those arrangements include deep vulnerabilities, strategic dependencies that could be exploited in a crisis, he will bear the consequences of choices we made without fully understanding them. This is true of many things we pass to the next generation, but digital infrastructure has a particular character. It is invisible until it fails. It is taken for granted until it is withdrawn. The dependencies accumulate silently, and by the time they become apparent, they may be very difficult to unwind.

I am not calling for panic. I am calling for attention. For honest assessment of where we actually stand. For recognition that sovereignty in the twenty-first century has a digital dimension that we have largely neglected. For conversations about what we are willing to pay, in money and convenience, for some degree of autonomy over the systems that underlie modern life.

The horse may have bolted. But the stable still exists, and there will be other horses. The question is whether we learn anything from how easily this one escaped.
