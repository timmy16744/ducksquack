I have been thinking lately about what comes after. Not after any particular crisis, though crises seem abundant enough, but after the long project of survival that has defined most of human existence. What do people do when they no longer have to do anything? The question used to feel like philosophy. It is starting to feel like something I need to answer for my son.

Let me explain what I mean, because I am aware this sounds abstract in a way that risks losing the thread before it begins.

For most of human history, nearly all human effort has been directed toward meeting basic needs. Growing food. Building shelter. Defending against threats. The peasant farmer of medieval Europe did not wonder about the meaning of work; work was survival, and survival was not optional. The question of purpose did not arise because purpose was obvious. You worked or you died. Your children worked or they died. This was the human condition for ten thousand years.

What we call civilisation is, in one sense, the slow process of reducing the effort required for survival. Each technological advance, from agriculture to the steam engine to the microprocessor, has freed some portion of human capacity from the brute demands of existence. The surplus thus created made possible everything we value: art, science, philosophy, the long accumulation of knowledge that distinguishes us from our ancestors who huddled in caves.

I find myself wondering whether we are approaching something like an endpoint of this trajectory. Not a utopia; I am suspicious of utopias. But a threshold beyond which the economics of survival change so fundamentally that the questions we have always asked about work and purpose and meaning require entirely different answers.

The trajectory I observe suggests that the cost of basic goods is falling toward zero, or something close enough to zero as to be functionally equivalent. This is not a prediction about next year. It is a direction of travel that has been consistent for decades and is now accelerating.

Consider what artificial intelligence is doing to the cost of cognitive labour. Tasks that once required expensive professionals can increasingly be performed by systems that cost fractions of a cent per operation. Consider what automation is doing to manufacturing. Consider what solar energy is doing to the cost of power, which underlies almost everything else. The curves all point the same direction: down, and accelerating.

If these trajectories continue, and I see no physical or economic law that would stop them, we arrive at something unprecedented. A world in which food, shelter, energy, transport, the basic infrastructure of survival, become so cheap as to be effectively free. Not literally free, perhaps, but cheap enough that their cost no longer organises human life in the way it always has.

I want to be careful here because predictions about technological transformation have a poor track record. The flying cars never arrived. The paperless office generated more paper than ever. I hold my expectations loosely, aware that the future has a habit of surprising those who think they can see it clearly.

But the direction seems clear even if the timeline remains uncertain. And the direction raises questions that I do not think we have adequately considered.

What happens to meaning when survival is no longer at stake?

This is not an idle question for me. I have some experience with it, though not by choice. Cluster headaches have forced me to construct a life that does not depend on conventional employment for its sense of purpose. When pain structures your existence to the degree that mine is structured, you either find meaning outside the normal channels or you do not find it at all. I found it, eventually, in my family, in the work I do for its own sake rather than for income, in the attempt to understand the world and leave something useful for my son.

This personal experience makes me both more optimistic and more cautious about the transition I am describing. More optimistic because I know it is possible to find purpose without necessity; I have done it. More cautious because I know how difficult the finding is, how easy it would be to lose the thread entirely, how much the search depends on resources and support that not everyone possesses.

The pessimistic view is that widespread freedom from necessity would produce widespread purposelessness. That meaning has always been tied to struggle, and without struggle there is no meaning. The anomie of affluent societies, the crisis of mental health among those who lack material want, suggests this is a real risk. We have already seen what happens when pockets of abundance emerge within a broader context of scarcity. The results are not uniformly encouraging.

But I do not think this pessimism captures the full picture. What I observe, both in myself and in others who have achieved some degree of freedom from necessity, is not the cessation of striving but its redirection. People do not stop wanting to create, to build, to solve problems, to excel. They want these things more, if anything, because they can finally pursue them without the distortion that survival pressure introduces.

I have come to think of this as Mastery Culture. It is a condition in which work persists but its character transforms. People still create, still build, still pour themselves into projects that demand everything they have. But they do so not because survival requires it but because excellence is intrinsically meaningful. The craftsman who makes furniture not to avoid starvation but because beautiful furniture is worth making. The engineer who designs systems not for a salary but because elegant systems are worth designing. The writer who writes not for publication but because the writing itself is the point.

I see glimpses of this already in the corners of the economy where survival pressure has receded. The open source developer who contributes thousands of hours to projects that will never pay them. The hobbyist machinist whose tolerances exceed what any commercial application requires. The musician who spends years perfecting a piece that a hundred people will hear. These are not economically rational behaviours in the conventional sense. They are expressions of something deeper; the human drive toward mastery that emerges whenever circumstances permit.

What strikes me about these examples is their intensity. The people I know who have found this kind of purpose do not work less than those driven by necessity. They often work more. But the quality of the effort is different. There is a joy in it, a sense of alignment between what they are doing and what they want to be doing, that survival labour rarely provides. The craftsman at midnight, perfecting a joint that no one will see, is not suffering. They are flourishing in a way that the wage worker watching the clock cannot access.

This is not a new idea. The Greeks had a concept, arete, that captured something like it: excellence for its own sake, the full expression of human capability. But arete was available only to a small elite whose survival was guaranteed by slaves and servants. What I am describing is the potential democratisation of that condition. Mastery Culture extended to everyone, not through redistribution of existing wealth but through the collapse of the costs that have always made survival the primary concern.

From my vantage point in Australia, I find myself thinking about what this might mean in concrete terms. We are a nation of twenty-six million people, resource-rich but manufacturing-poor, dependent on supply chains we do not control and security arrangements we did not design. If the trajectory I am describing unfolds, it changes our position fundamentally.

I write this with a particular awareness of our vulnerability. We export iron ore and coal and lithium, and we import nearly everything that requires sophisticated manufacturing. We cannot make an EpiPen. We import ninety percent of our pharmaceuticals. When the pandemic disrupted supply chains, we discovered how thin the margins of our self-sufficiency actually were. This is not a comfortable position for a nation whose strategic environment is becoming more contested by the year.

But the same technologies that create this vulnerability might also resolve it. That is what I find myself returning to.

Consider manufacturing. The economic logic of offshoring depended on labour cost differentials. When production required human workers, it made sense to locate factories where labour was cheap. As manufacturing becomes increasingly automated, that logic weakens. Robots do not demand wages. AI systems do not require health insurance. The cost advantages of distant production diminish while the risks of supply chain vulnerability remain.

What becomes possible is domestic production at competitive costs. Not a return to the factories of the mid-twentieth century, but something new: automated facilities that can manufacture sophisticated goods locally. A nation with such capacity becomes, in a meaningful sense, self-sufficient. It cannot be held hostage by distant suppliers. Its economic resilience does not depend on the goodwill of trading partners or the stability of shipping routes.

I think of this as the Closed Loop; an economy that can provision itself without external dependency. Not isolationist, because trade would remain valuable for variety and efficiency. But sovereign in a way that Australia has never been sovereign. We have always depended on others for the manufactured goods that modern life requires. The possibility of closing that loop, of producing what we need with our own resources and our own automated systems, represents a genuine transformation.

There is a similar logic in defence. The traditional model of military power centred on expensive platforms: aircraft carriers, fighter jets, systems that cost billions and take decades to develop. These are increasingly vulnerable to cheap countermeasures. A missile costing a few hundred thousand dollars can destroy a ship costing several billion. The economics have inverted.

What is emerging is something different. Autonomous systems that cost thousands rather than millions, deployed in swarms that overwhelm through numbers rather than individual capability. Companies like Anduril have pioneered this approach, and the implications extend beyond military strategy. When defence becomes cheap and distributed, the calculus of aggression changes. Deterrence becomes not a threat of retaliation but a guarantee of failure.

I call this Peace Infrastructure; not peace as the absence of war, achieved through negotiation and maintained through vigilance, but peace as a utility, as reliable and automatic as electricity or running water. The idea sounds utopian, and perhaps it is. But the technological foundations are becoming visible, and I find myself unable to dismiss the possibility.

There is a third element I want to mention, though it may seem distant from questions of manufacturing and defence. It concerns money.

The financial system as currently constituted is built on fractional reserve banking. When you deposit money, the bank lends most of it out, keeping only a fraction in reserve. This creates systemic fragility. If confidence fails, if depositors demand their money simultaneously, the system collapses. We have seen this pattern repeatedly, and each time the response has been to paper over the problem rather than resolve it.

For the transition I am describing, this fragility is a significant obstacle. Innovation requires patient capital invested over long time horizons. The builders who will construct the infrastructure of abundance need to know their resources are secure. They cannot operate effectively if their capital is subject to periodic destruction through systemic crises.

The alternative is something simpler: banking where deposits are held in full, where the money you deposit is the money the bank holds. This sacrifices some credit expansion but provides absolute stability of capital. The foundation for long-term investment becomes unshakeable. I have come to think of this as Bedrock Capital; the stable base upon which everything else can be built.

These three elements; the Closed Loop, Peace Infrastructure, and Bedrock Capital; together constitute what I think of as the preconditions for Mastery Culture. They are the foundations upon which a genuine transformation in human life might be built. Security that does not depend on the restraint of adversaries. Economic resilience that does not depend on distant supply chains. Financial stability that does not depend on confidence games.

I am aware that this sounds grandiose. I am aware that predictions of transformation have a poor track record. I hold all of this loosely, aware that the future may unfold in ways I cannot anticipate.

But I keep returning to my son. Arthur will grow up in whatever world we manage to build or fail to build. If the trajectories I observe continue, he may live to see something like what I have described: a world in which survival is automated and the question of purpose must be answered in entirely new ways.

I want him to be ready for that. I want him to understand that meaning can be found in mastery, in craft, in the pursuit of excellence for its own sake. I want him to know that the absence of necessity does not have to mean the absence of purpose. That humans have always created, always strived, always reached for something beyond mere survival; and that this reaching is not a response to scarcity but something deeper, something intrinsic to what we are.

The transition will not be seamless. There will be disruption, displacement, the painful unravelling of arrangements that no longer serve. Some people will find the new world liberating. Others will find it terrifying. The psychological work of learning to derive meaning from excellence rather than necessity is not trivial, and not everyone will manage it.

But I think it is coming, in some form, on some timeline. The alternative; that we continue indefinitely in the current mode, with survival pressure organising human life as it always has; seems to me less likely than the transformation. The trajectories are too clear, the technologies too powerful, the direction too consistent.

After scarcity, mastery. After survival, craft. After necessity, the question of what we actually want to do with our one precious life.

I do not know exactly what that world looks like. I am not sure anyone can know. But I find myself thinking about it more often as Arthur grows, as I watch him discover the satisfaction of making something with his own hands, of solving a problem through persistence and attention. He does not yet know about economic necessity. For him, the building is the point. The creation is the reward. I want him to hold onto that, even as the world teaches him that work is supposed to be something you endure for money.

Perhaps the world I am describing would let him keep that orientation. Perhaps all of us could recover something we lost when survival became the organising principle of existence. The child who builds for the joy of building is not naive. They are in touch with something fundamental that adults have been forced to forget.

I want to be ready for what is coming, and I want my son to be ready for it. The rustle in the grass is not only warning of danger. Sometimes it is the sound of something new approaching.

The wise, I suspect, are already listening.
