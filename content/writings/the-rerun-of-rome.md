I have been thinking a great deal lately about pattern recognition. Not in the machine learning sense, though that interest of mine bleeds into everything, but in the historical sense. The human brain evolved to detect patterns because patterns kept us alive. The rustle in the grass that preceded the predator. The changing of seasons that preceded famine. We are, at our core, prediction machines.

And so I find myself unable to ignore certain patterns that have begun to crystallise in my mind over the past several years. Patterns that connect the world I observe through my window in 2011 to accounts written nearly two millennia ago about a civilisation that, at its height, must have seemed as permanent and inevitable as the American project seems today.

I want to be clear from the outset that I am not making a prophecy. Prophecy is the domain of charlatans and the self-deceived. What I am doing is something more modest and, I hope, more useful. I am asking whether the structural conditions that preceded Rome's long decline are beginning to manifest in the American context, and if so, what that might mean for those of us who will live through the coming decades.

Let us begin with the financial crisis of 2008, because I think future historians will mark it as more significant than we currently appreciate. The crisis itself was dramatic enough, but what interests me more is the response. The Roman Empire, in its declining centuries, repeatedly debased its currency to paper over structural economic problems. The denarius, which had been nearly pure silver under Augustus, contained barely five percent silver by the reign of Gallienus. This was not done out of malice or stupidity. It was done because the alternative, genuine reform of the underlying economic structure, was politically impossible.

Watch what the Federal Reserve is doing with quantitative easing. I am not saying it is wrong. I am not qualified to make that judgement. But I am saying that the pattern rhymes. When a state cannot or will not address structural problems directly, it turns to monetary manipulation as a substitute for genuine reform. The can gets kicked down the road, and the road grows shorter with each kick.

Then there is the matter of military overextension. I walked past a news stand yesterday and counted references to our ongoing operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, and Libya. Rome, at the height of its power, maintained legions across three continents. This was sustainable when the empire was expanding and the spoils of conquest funded further conquest. It became unsustainable when the expansion stopped but the commitments remained.

The United States has over seven hundred military bases in foreign countries. Seven hundred. The annual defence budget exceeds that of the next dozen nations combined. And yet we struggle to articulate what victory looks like in any of our current engagements. We are fighting, as Rome did in its later centuries, not to expand but merely to maintain. The psychological shift this represents is profound, even if it goes largely unacknowledged.

I am struck too by the growing distance between the political class and the citizenry. In the Roman Republic, there was a concept called virtus, a kind of civic virtue that bound citizens to the state and to each other. By the late Empire, this had been replaced by what we might call transactional politics. The state provided bread and circuses, and in exchange the populace provided acquiescence. The relationship became one of mutual cynicism rather than mutual obligation.

Consider the spectacle of American politics in 2011. The Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street represent, in their different ways, a profound loss of faith in institutional legitimacy. People across the political spectrum have begun to suspect that the game is rigged, that the system serves interests other than their own. This suspicion may be more or less accurate in its specifics, but its existence as a widespread phenomenon is itself significant. Legitimacy, once lost, is extraordinarily difficult to rebuild.

The infrastructure question troubles me as well. Rome built roads and aqueducts that functioned for centuries. In the later period of decline, maintenance was deferred, then neglected, then forgotten. The American Society of Civil Engineers currently gives American infrastructure a grade of D. Not a metaphorical D, an actual letter grade in an actual report. Bridges are structurally deficient. Water systems leak. The electrical grid operates on technology that would be familiar to engineers from the 1960s.

There is something almost too on the nose about a civilisation that cannot maintain its bridges. Bridges are such obvious symbols of connection, of the binding together of a nation, that their decay reads like heavy-handed fiction. And yet here we are.

I want to address a possible objection. One might argue that these comparisons are facile, that America in 2011 is nothing like Rome in 200 or 300 CE, that the technological and social contexts are so different as to make comparison meaningless. This objection has merit, but I think it misses the deeper point.

The specific causes of Roman decline are debated by historians and probably always will be. Lead poisoning, Christianity, barbarian invasions, soil exhaustion, moral decay, the list goes on. But beneath all these specific causes lies a more general pattern. Complex systems, whether they are empires or ecosystems or economies, can absorb shocks and maintain their structure up to a point. Beyond that point, they undergo phase transitions. They reorganise into different configurations. The old system does not so much fall as transform into something that its inhabitants would not recognise as continuous with what came before.

The question I am asking is whether America has begun to approach such a transition point. Not whether it will happen tomorrow or next year or even in my lifetime. But whether the early signatures of systemic stress are becoming visible to those who care to look.

I do not think this is a cause for despair. Rome's decline, after all, was also a transformation. New forms of social organisation emerged from the old. The medieval world that followed was not worse than Rome in any absolute sense, merely different. Human beings continued to love and create and strive for meaning.

But I do think it is a cause for seriousness. If we are indeed in the early stages of a major historical transition, then the choices we make in the coming decades will shape what comes after. The Romans of the third century could not have prevented the transformation of their world, but they could have influenced its direction. Some did, and their influence echoes down to us today.

I suppose what I am really arguing for is a certain quality of attention. Not panic, which is useless. Not denial, which is worse than useless. But a clear-eyed willingness to look at the patterns in front of us and ask what they might mean. The rustle in the grass may be nothing. Or it may be something. Either way, it seems worth noticing.
