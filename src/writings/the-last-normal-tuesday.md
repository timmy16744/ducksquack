We're not declining. We're already dead.

Sydney terrace houses measuring 38 square meters of rotting timber sell for $1.3 million. Youth unemployment hits 10.4% while we rank 102nd in economic complexity, sandwiched between Bangladesh and Senegal. Manufacturing has collapsed to 5.9% of GDP. We export 74% of our natural gas then wonder why 1,400 manufacturers have shuttered since 2022.

This isn't a recession. It's rigor mortis.

## The Property Psychosis

Sydney's property market has achieved what Weimar Germany only dreamed of. House prices up 4,645% since 1975. Wages crawled up just 1,183%. The median house now demands 9.5 times the median wage, up from 4 times when your parents bought in.

Scott Farquhar's Point Piper mansion fetched $130 million in October. That same month, a 38-square-meter Surry Hills terrace commanded $1.3 million. That's $34,000 per square meter of Australian dream.

But here's where it gets truly psychotic: 46 Gordon Street, Paddington. A terrace house. Five bedrooms, four bathrooms. Buyer's guide? $10 million. Ten. Million. Dollars. For a terrace. Not a mansion. Not waterfront. A terrace in Paddington. When terraces in the same suburb sold for $50,000 in the 1980s, this represents a 20,000% increase. We're not just in bubble territory. We've left Earth's atmosphere.

The acceleration patterns scream Weimar: properties gaining $50 million in three years, uninhabitable shacks selling for $2.1 million, mortgage payments requiring 143% of the median monthly wage. Properties that sold for $85,000 in 1985 now fetch $1.7 million despite being condemned.

The Reserve Bank projects $2 million median prices by 2026. Only 13% of homes remain affordable to median-income households. We're not just priced out. We're locked out of existence itself.

## The AI Guillotine

While you're refreshing property listings you'll never afford, AI is sharpening its blade for Australian necks. And the numbers everyone's quoting? They're hilariously, catastrophically wrong.

McKinsey says 1.3 million workers will need to "transition" by 2030. The Social Policy Group warns 33% of Australia's workforce could face displacement. These projections assume linear progress. They assume AI capabilities plateau. They assume we have time to adapt.

They're written by people who haven't noticed that GPT-4 to GPT-5 wasn't an incremental improvement but a capability explosion. Who haven't seen entire customer service departments vaporize overnight. Who don't understand that when AI can code, write, analyze, design, and soon physically manipulate objects through robotics, there's nowhere to hide.

The real number? 30% is the absolute minimum by 2030. The floor, not the ceiling. We're watching capabilities double every six months while our "reskilling programs" teach people to use Microsoft Excel. Silicon Valley companies are already operating with 80% fewer employees than two years ago. Law firms have cut junior positions by 40%. Accounting graduates can't find work because AI does their job for $20 a month.

Five million Australian jobs won't transition. They'll disappear. Financial services leads the massacre with 45.8% of banking roles eliminated by 2027. Commonwealth Bank already cut 90 jobs, replacing humans with chatbots. But that's just the appetizer. Wait until AI agents can handle complex negotiations, medical diagnoses, architectural design, and legal research. Wait until they're better at these tasks than humans. That wait? About 18 months.

Women are 1.2 times more likely to face the axe. Low-wage workers? 14 times more vulnerable than their bosses. But here's the twist: the bosses are going too. Middle management, analysts, consultants, all the six-figure jobs that seemed safe? AI eats them for breakfast.

We rank 15th out of 36 OECD countries for AI preparedness. We produce 93,302 AI research papers but only 4,075 patents, just 0.18% of global output. China files more AI patents in a month than Australia has in its entire history.

We're not preparing for the future. We're sleepwalking into obsolescence while the rest of the world sprints past us.

## Manufacturing's Death Certificate

Australia's manufacturing didn't decline. It committed suicide. From 28% of GDP in the 1960s to 5.9% today, the lowest in the OECD. We now rank 102nd globally in economic complexity, keeping company with Bangladesh and Senegal despite being the 8th richest nation per capita.

The dependency is absolute: 85% of medical devices imported, 90% of pharmaceuticals, 95% of ibuprofen. We can't manufacture EpiPens. We can't make semiconductors. We can't produce most items on the WHO's Essential Medicines list. When Ford, Holden, and Toyota closed in 2017, they took 120 suppliers with them. Since 2022, energy costs alone have killed 1,400 manufacturers, including Oceania Glass after 169 years and Qenos, our only plastics manufacturer.

Manufacturing employment has collapsed from 10.7% to 6.2% of the workforce. NSW lost 67,000 jobs. Victoria lost 65,000. Toolmakers down 20%. Engineering pattern makers? Extinct. Our only new export product in 15 years? Rare earth metals worth a laughable $80.9 million annually.

We don't make things anymore. We just dig and ship.

## The Singapore Solution They Won't Implement

Watch how real countries operate:

Singapore demands Employment Pass holders earn minimum $5,000 monthly. Employers pay $300-800 levies per foreign worker. Only those earning $6,000+ can bring families. Result: $88,429 GDP per capita, 0.17 homicides per 100,000, world's #1 safety ranking despite 42% foreign workforce.

Japan maintains 3.04% foreign population through points-based evaluation. Their "Specified Skilled Worker" program attracted fewer than 3,000 applicants despite targeting thousands. Crime rate: 0.26 homicides per 100,000, thirty times lower than the US.

Monaco requires €500,000-1,000,000 bank deposits plus property ownership. Switzerland limits non-EU nationals to 3,500 work permits annually. Norway DNA-tests family reunification applications, detecting 25-40% fraud.

These aren't suggestions. They're proven models. But Australia's politicians are too busy buying beachfront mansions to notice.

## The Automation Revolution We're Ignoring

Rio Tinto runs the world's largest robot in the Pilbara: 50 autonomous trains carrying 28,000 tonnes each across 1,700km of track. Speed increased 5-6%. Costs down 15%. One operator in Perth controls 8 drilling rigs 1,500km away.

The Netherlands became the world's second-largest food exporter despite being 270 times smaller than the USA. How? Automation. Their precision farming yields 20+ tons of potatoes per acre versus the 9-ton global average. That's 122% improvement. Automated greenhouses achieved 90% water reduction, 97% pesticide elimination, operating 24/7 without human intervention.

Japan's Spread Company produces 21,000 lettuces daily through full automation, scaling to 50,000. John Deere's See & Spray technology reduces herbicide use by 97% while autonomous tractors boost productivity by 20%.

The global autonomous farming equipment market will hit $9.77 billion by 2030. Australia's contribution? We're still debating whether to allow Uber.

## Energy Abundance, Political Stupidity

Here's the punchline that should make you laugh if it wasn't so tragic: Australia possesses the world's largest uranium reserves at 1.68 million tonnes, 31% of global supply. We maintain a complete nuclear ban. We hold the third-largest coal reserves at 147-160 billion tonnes. We're closing all plants by 2038. Natural gas reserves of 2.4 trillion cubic meters? We export 74% while domestic manufacturers suffocate.

Now watch what competent governance looks like. Norway discovered oil in 1969. Instead of pissing it away on property speculation and tax cuts for mining magnates, they created the Government Pension Fund Global. Today it's worth $1.7 trillion. That's $300,000 for every Norwegian citizen. The fund owns 1.5% of all global stocks. It generates enough returns to fund their entire transition to post-carbon economy while maintaining the highest living standards on Earth.

Norway's citizens enjoy free healthcare, free education including university, 49 weeks paid parental leave, and guaranteed pensions. Their GDP per capita? $94,660. Ours? $64,674. They achieved this with one resource: oil. We have uranium, coal, gas, iron ore, lithium, rare earths, gold, and agricultural land that could feed Asia. Our sovereign wealth fund? The Future Fund has $230 billion. That's $8,800 per Australian versus $300,000 per Norwegian.

But it gets worse. The nuclear ban could be lifted by deleting four words from the EPBC Act. Four words stand between us and energy independence. Meanwhile, east coast gas prices have tripled since 2015. Western Australia's 15% domestic reservation keeps their prices 50% lower, proving the solution already exists. We export 100% of uranium, 90% of black coal, and may soon import LNG despite being the world's second-largest exporter.

Norway used oil wealth to prepare for a post-oil future. They're ready for the AI transition with a financial cushion that could support their entire population through decades of disruption. Australia? We sold our resources cheap, saved nothing, and now face 30% minimum unemployment by 2030 with no safety net, no sovereign fund, no plan.

This energy poverty amid infinite resources has killed Oceania Glass after 169 years, threatens BlueScope Steel and Orica, and driven manufacturing from 14% of GDP to 5%. Electricity prices have murdered 1,400 manufacturers since 2022 while we power multiple foreign nations. We had forty years to build a Norwegian-style sovereign fund. Instead, we built a housing bubble where Paddington terraces cost $10 million.

The AI revolution won't wait for us to catch up. Norway's citizens can weather any storm with $300,000 per person in sovereign wealth. Australians? We've got mortgage debt and the promise of "reskilling programs" that teach obsolete skills for jobs that won't exist.

## The Demographic Cliff

Fertility rate: 1.50 births per woman. Lowest ever recorded. Well below 2.1 replacement. Only 286,998 births in 2023, the lowest since 2006. The median couple needs $161,000 income for the median house. Homeownership among 25-29 year-olds fell from 43.2% to 36.1%. Young adults can afford 13% of homes sold.

The brain drain accelerates. In May 2021, 363,796 Australians applied to leave when only 362,000 job vacancies existed. Scientists report 70.6% fatigue with one-in-five actively seeking career changes. Just 16% of international students become permanent residents despite years of investment in their education.

The Prime Minister bought a $4 million beachfront mansion during the housing crisis. Parliament fills with property speculators while citizens can't afford first homes. GDP per capita contracted for six consecutive quarters, the longest recession in 50 years. Real disposable income down 8.7%. Productivity down 6.3%.

## What Actually Works

The USA's CHIPS Act created 115,000 jobs across 16 semiconductor facilities with $400 billion committed. Manufacturing added 642,000 jobs since 2021. Construction of new facilities up 116%. The US will produce 30% of leading-edge chips by 2032, up from 0% when Biden took office.

Vietnam's manufacturing contributes over 20% of GDP with 8% growth, adding 1.5 million jobs between 2014-2016. Mexico attracted $170-200 billion in investment between January 2023 and August 2024.

China's Made in China 2025 achieved dominance through state support averaging 4.5% of firm revenues. Chinese firms control 58% of global EV markets, 85% of battery production. They didn't wait for the market to decide. They decided for the market.

## The Prescription Nobody Will Fill

Lift the nuclear ban. Implement 15% domestic gas reservation. Deploy automation achieving 20-122% productivity gains. Adopt Singapore-style immigration with $80,000+ salary thresholds. Provide 3-5% revenue support to strategic manufacturing.

Without radical transformation: minimum 30% unemployment by 2030 as AI capabilities explode exponentially, manufacturing extinct, youth unemployment exceeding 20%, property prices hitting $2 million median while terraces in Paddington demand $10 million, complete import dependency for basic necessities.

We possess every resource needed for prosperity: uranium, coal, gas, rare earths, agricultural land. What we lack is leadership that understands exponential change. Countries implementing strategic industrial policy, selective immigration, and automation achieve measurable success within 5 years.

Australia's crisis is self-inflicted and reversible. But reversible requires acknowledging that the AI revolution isn't coming in decades. It's here, accelerating faster than our ability to comprehend it. While we debate and form committees, entire industries evaporate overnight.

The system is already dead. The question is whether we'll build something new from the corpse or just keep pretending it's still breathing while $10 million terraces and 30% unemployment become the new normal.

Tuesday morning five years from now won't just look different. It will be unrecognizable. And we're not even trying to prepare for it.
