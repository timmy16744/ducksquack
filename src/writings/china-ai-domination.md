The narrative of the U.S. versus China in AI often paints the picture of a race with two contenders – but is the U.S. really still leading, or has China already won? The truth may surprise you. While it's true that the U.S. remains the dominant force in some areas of AI, China is rapidly catching up in critical aspects. Momentum, as any entrepreneur will tell you, matters more than milestones. And China's momentum in AI, semiconductors, and technology manufacturing isn't just impressive – it's becoming nearly unstoppable.

In a race with no finish line, every incremental advantage compounds into long-term dominance. China is not just moving fast, but in a multi-pronged assault across technology sectors. From open-source AI models and semiconductor innovations to energy production and industrial capacity, China is positioning itself to dominate all the critical technologies of the 21st century. And let's be clear, when it comes to momentum, the U.S. is not just behind; it's struggling to keep up.

**Manufacturing: China's Unrivaled Edge**

One key reason China's momentum seems insurmountable is its manufacturing dominance. China's manufacturing base is so vast that it holds a massive strategic advantage over the U.S. China controls about 29% of global manufacturing, dwarfing its competitors. This isn't just about making cheap gadgets – it's about being the backbone of AI hardware and semiconductor production, two sectors that the U.S. is increasingly dependent on. If China ever escalates tensions over Taiwan, where TSMC currently supplies the U.S. with 92% of its advanced chips, the U.S. would be left vulnerable, unable to source its critical components . But China isn't just waiting around; it's been working tirelessly to replace the U.S. in semiconductors with Huawei's CloudMatrix 384, a formidable alternative to Nvidia's chips. The Taiwan issue looms large, but China's push for domestic semiconductor independence may end up making the U.S. more reliant on Taiwan than ever .

What's more, China's manufacturing infrastructure is unparalleled, making it the preferred player in high-tech, from AI servers to electric vehicles, and its leapfrogging of the U.S. in critical industries is a prime example of how momentum drives success.

**The Open-Source Advantage: China's Model Ecosystem**

While the U.S. has long kept its best AI models locked behind paywalls, China's open-source AI ecosystem is where the real game-changer is happening. Huawei, Baidu, Alibaba, and others have flooded the market with top-tier, open-source AI models like DeepSeek, Qwen, and Zhipu's GLM 4.5 – all of which are already challenging the U.S.'s top proprietary models like Google's Gemini and OpenAI's GPT-4 . By embracing open-source, Chinese companies can undercut their competition on pricing, boost AI accessibility, and rapidly scale up the AI ecosystem. This Darwinian competition in China fuels growth at an astonishing rate, making the entire sector stronger . In the U.S., on the other hand, secrecy and competition-driven acquisition are slowing down the diffusion of knowledge. Companies are stuck hoarding their secrets, which means technological progress is slower and more costly .

In short, China's open-source ecosystem is not only challenging U.S. AI supremacy but could soon leave it behind. The next great AI breakthrough could come from China's decentralized open models, leaving the U.S. scrambling to catch up.

**Energy Production: The Fuel for AI**

Powering AI infrastructure takes immense energy, and China's energy production capabilities are vast. With an energy capacity nearly 2.5 times that of the U.S., China can support gigantic AI data centers, scaling up its AI ambitions without the energy constraints the U.S. faces . While the U.S. struggles with power bottlenecks, China has already begun constructing enormous renewable energy farms to feed its expanding AI infrastructure, all while the U.S. faces rising energy prices and strained grids . China's capacity to ramp up energy production at scale ensures that its AI systems will always have the juice they need to stay ahead in the race.

**Military Capacity: An Industrial Powerhouse**

China is also flexing its muscle on the military-industrial front. According to defense experts like Palmer Luckey, China's shipbuilding capacity is 350 times greater than that of the U.S. – a chilling statistic that demonstrates China's superior industrial base. While the U.S. stagnates in this sector, China's civil-military fusion ensures that its entire economy can pivot to military production at a moment's notice, undermining U.S. military advantage . This ability to mobilize massive industrial output could allow China to outproduce the U.S. in a military conflict or global race for AI infrastructure. China's integrated system of manufacturing, AI integration, and military readiness gives it a clear advantage in shaping the future of global power.

**The Case for China's Supremacy**

Despite what some pundits may claim, China has already created the conditions for its eventual dominance in AI and technology. Manufacturing supremacy, open-source AI innovation, unmatched energy production, and a state-backed industrial strategy all place China in the driver's seat. The U.S. has had its time, but momentum is everything. With China's rapidly accelerating growth and relentless drive for self-sufficiency, it's not just about catching up—it's about a redefined global order.

America's competitive edge, particularly in its proprietary AI models and cloud infrastructure, may still seem formidable today, but momentum is building in China and could soon make the U.S. obsolete. From military dominance to AI supremacy, China is shaping the future. If the U.S. cannot catch up with China's breakneck pace of innovation and overcome its internal political divides, China will win – and they will do it faster than anyone could have predicted.

Keep innovating, or risk being left behind.
