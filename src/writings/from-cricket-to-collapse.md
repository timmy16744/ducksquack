Australia isn't the land of mateship anymore. It's the playground for a privileged few squeezing the rest of us dry. Politicians pull in $600k+ while your account shrinks. Mateship? It's daylight robbery. We're richer on paper than ever, yet you've never felt poorer.

We'll tear Steve Smith apart for Sandpapergate, but the politicians who decide whether we live or die glide past real scrutiny. Three consecutive quarters of economic contraction should bench a cabinet, not hand them new portfolios. Meanwhile, 50% of 16-year-olds are unable to swim, small businesses shut daily, and households cling to a token 3% wage rise that employers claw back with shorter rosters.

## The Overpaid Political Class

The very people presiding over this mess are the best-paid public officials on Earth. The Prime Minister clears about A$607k a year and back-bench MPs start above A$230k, more than counterparts in much larger economies. Paying corporate-tier salaries attracts careerists, not custodians.

Peg their pay to the lower 50% of national incomes: if Australians can't afford to eat, neither should their leaders.

## Resource Wealth Squandered

We also sit on an unrivalled treasure chest of minerals: roughly a fifth of global lithium, a third of rutile and iron ore, world-class nickel, copper, and rare-earth deposits. Yet we export raw ore at discount and buy back finished batteries at luxury prices. The same lunacy plays out in agriculture: our beef is so prized it's cheaper on a Shanghai menu than in a suburban Coles. Regulations suffocate anyone who tries to fix this.

It's like AFL umpiring: everyone knows the officiating is hopeless, so the league kept adding more umpires until the game became a whistle-blown muddle. What footy needs is fewer whistles and more accountability; what the economy needs is fewer overlapping regulators and genuine transparency. Instead, red tape turns building a mine, abattoir, or small startup into a bureaucratic marathon.

## Policy Failures Across the Board

Energy policy is another own goal. With endless sunlight and empty desert, we could carpet a slice of the outback in solar panels, pair them with grid-scale batteries, and power the nation. Instead, governments jack up power bills and slash feed-in tariffs so rooftop-PV households earn cents per kilowatt-hour while gentailers post record profits.

Add in a housing market inflated beyond reach, fossil-fuel subsidies propping up 50Â°C summers, "Closing the Gap" targets missed year after year, an NBN that's 83rd in the world, defence R&D starved while we sign foreign cheques, and an AI wave barreling toward us with no credible national reskilling plan.

The general public has no idea how much wealth AI will unleash, prosperity on a scale humanity's never seen, because the people most likely to lose their privileged positions aren't about to broadcast it. Instead, through the media they control, they peddle fear and division to keep everyone distracted and docile.

## Building for the Future

I don't want my newborn son merely surviving this Australia; I want him thriving in one. That demands leaders who build the future, not monuments to past failures.

The solution? A clean slate: a party led by the generation that will actually live with tomorrow's tech. Replace the parade of grumpy lifers with people fluent in AI and automation, ready to funnel our resource windfall into national programmes that matter:

- Medicare that covers all medical needs, not just the basics
- Energy, broadband, and baseline AI access treated as human rights
- Export levies channelled straight into local batteries, green power, and community infrastructure: markets, cafes, maker spaces, so value circulates at street level instead of in conglomerate boardrooms

We're heading into a world of material abundance where purpose and individuality risk evaporating. Let's build a government that sees the change coming and prepares for it rather than scrambling to catch up.
