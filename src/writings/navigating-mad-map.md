We are at the kind of moment that, looking back, will feel obvious. The technology is here, moving faster than anything we have ever built, and the next five years will fix the trajectory. Which future we get is still open, but not for long.

I think of it as two maps. The first is MAD (Mutual Assured Destruction). AI makes every human weakness sharper. Wars become more efficient. Inequality grows. Disinformation becomes constant background noise. Trust in institutions erodes until it is almost impossible to rebuild. The second is MAP (Mutual Assured Prosperity). AI becomes the most powerful amplifier for progress in history, lifting living standards, accelerating science, and creating abundance.

Both paths are visible. Which one we take depends on decisions we make now.

## The MAD Path

MAD is not speculation. We are already seeing the early signs. Autonomous weapons that operate at machine speed. State-scale cyberattacks with precision targeting. Propaganda factories that run nonstop without fatigue. The danger here is that it does not feel like a single, shattering event. It feels like a slow drift. Privacy disappears piece by piece. The rules bend slightly at first, then more sharply toward those who already hold power. Over time, instability becomes the new normal.

Once that happens, reversing course becomes far harder.

## The MAP Path

MAP is not utopia. It is simply a future where our problems get solved faster than they appear. Imagine an AI-driven research ecosystem that eliminates extreme poverty, cures most major diseases, and creates personalised education for everyone. Picture economies rebuilt around abundance instead of scarcity, and governance systems informed by high-quality, real-time decision tools. In this version of the future, AI does not erase our problems entirely, but it makes them far more manageable.

It is important to note that MAP will not arrive automatically. It requires coordination, good governance, and a willingness to address problems before they are irreversible.

## The Next Five Years: Locks and Levers

The next half-decade will set the foundation for how AI is built, deployed, and governed. Certain choices, once made, will be extremely difficult to undo. Four moves matter more than the rest:

**Regulation That Matches Velocity**: We need governance that moves at the speed of the technology. Safety checks, transparent reporting, and global standards can coexist with innovation if designed well. Waiting will only ensure that the most dangerous systems are deployed without oversight.

**Redefining Work**: AI will replace tasks before it replaces whole jobs, but eventually it will restructure the labor market. This is a chance to create entirely new industries and new kinds of work. Reskilling needs to be more than a slogan, and safety nets must be designed for a reality where automation is everywhere.

**Privacy by Default**: AI will process unprecedented volumes of personal data. Without ownership and consent built into the architecture, we will drift into surveillance as the default state. Fixing this later will be almost impossible.

**Cooperation Over Arms Race**: If countries treat AI development as a zero-sum race, MAD becomes inevitable. Sharing safety research, creating interoperable standards, and cooperating on oversight of the most capable systems increases the odds of MAP.

## Why It Is Our Decision

AI will not choose between MAD and MAP. We will. Acting as if we have unlimited time is the same as deciding not to act. The speed of the technology means that later is rarely later. It is never.

Humans have avoided worst-case scenarios before. We can do it again. If we get this right, AI will be remembered as the technology that fundamentally upgraded human capability. If we fail, it will be remembered as the technology that made our problems unmanageable.

The map is already drawn. The route is still ours to pick.
