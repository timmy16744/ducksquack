Let's start with the core premise: Australia's economy is no longer in decline. It has already failed structurally, technologically, and demographically. The signs are everywhere. Housing functions as a speculative asset. Employment has decoupled from productive value. Our national infrastructure is reliant on foreign compute, foreign capital, and foreign vision. The state has ceded control of the future and replaced it with legislative theatre.

In this context, rational actors don't seek participation. They build insulation. Integration into legacy systems, whether political, corporate, or social, is no longer a lever for change. It's latency.

This perspective isn't an abstract theory for me. It's a reality crystallized by a 15-year battle within a healthcare system that proves the rule.

## The Personal Cost of a Failed System

I live with cluster headaches: technically the worst pain known to humankind.I spend over 50% of my life experiencing this pain, helplessly alone. I didn't choose to live this life but i have chosen how to survive. My journey through the medical system has been a 15-year case study in its failure: well over 100 trialed drugs, six surgeries, and a brain implant that was a for-profit procedure I never should have had (but at least my surgeon got a new car). The Australian health system isn't equipped for edge cases; it can't solve what doesn't fit its actuarial design. Every interaction produces compounding failures: financially, functionally, psychologically.

So I had to build a system around it. The 25,000+ steps a day minimum, the two-hour resistance training sessions, the strict caloric, cognitive, and environmental control. This isn't fitness. It's runtime maintenance. A personal operating system patched daily to prevent collapse.

What once created satisfaction now triggers dread. The idea of "fun" is irrelevant, corrupted by anticipatory anxiety and chemical unpredictability. This isn't burnout; it's a total system reroute away from pleasure-seeking in favour of functional preservation. So I don't pursue enjoyment. I execute protocols. Every action serves one of two functions: prevent system degradation or transfer knowledge downstream. That distinction eliminates motivational variance. I do what must be done, or I deteriorate.

## The AI Transition: A Mathematical Certainty Managed by the Incompetent

This firsthand experience with broken governance is precisely why I'm so concerned about the next great challenge: the AI transition. To be clear, I am not an AI doomer. I believe it will eventually create a utopian society. The problem is the perilous path to get there, and we are being led by an industry of politicians who still don't understand how the internet works in 2025.

Their policy response, centered on "reskilling," is a dangerously misguided reaction to the mathematical reality of the disruption. Unlike past technological shifts, AI is a General-Purpose Technology targeting cognitive work. It's simultaneously automating both blue-collar and white-collar jobs. Goldman Sachs projects it could automate tasks equivalent to 300 million full-time jobs worldwide. McKinsey estimates up to 30% of all hours worked could be automated by 2030. For Australia, the forecast is that one-third of our entire workforce could face displacement in that same timeframe.

The historical "cognitive ladder" where a displaced factory worker could retrain for an office job is collapsing. AI is eliminating the junior and administrative roles that formed the rungs of that ladder. The consequences are already here. Post-education unemployment for Gen Z is reportedly approaching 60%, a catastrophic figure compared to the historical average of 25%. We are creating a lost generation in real time.

And yet the policy response is "reskilling." You cannot reskill millions of people for a handful of expert roles, especially when only 20% of displaced workers have the educational foundation to even attempt the transition, and only 7% of companies are actively developing a strategy to help them. It's a fantasy.

## No One Is Coming

This leads to an unavoidable truth: there is no fix coming from within the system. Fiscal policy is reactive. Monetary tools are exhausted. Electoral participation is a symbolic ritual. Governments no longer govern; they triage optics. They do not forecast; they manage perception.

The social fallout of this inaction will be a crisis of meaning. For centuries, the work ethic has been the cornerstone of our society. Widespread, permanent unemployment will trigger a collective trauma, leaving a vacuum of purpose. The long-term unemployed are more than three times as likely to suffer from depression. We are engineering a crisis of mass despair. The idea that "we're all in this together" fails every test of power, capital, and risk exposure. If you still believe it, you haven't run the numbers.

## So, What Do You Actually Do?

You stop building for yourself. You stop seeking recovery. You start constructing continuity.

This is the answer: you leverage AI, the very tool of disruption, as the great enabler. The industrial era was defined by economies of scale. The AI era enables economies of individuality. An individual with an "AI toolkit" for coding, marketing, product design, and logistics can now perform the work of an entire department.

So you build the tools for a local, artisanal economy. You create durable, replicable systems that give skilled individuals and small producers the ability to insulate themselves. You connect the digital empowerment of AI to the physical infrastructure of local makerspaces, creating a seamless pipeline from idea to object, all within a community. It's not about SaaS growth; it's about local replication. It's not about optimisation; it's about durability. My personal infrastructure is the same: automated, documented, and versioned. Self-executing even when I'm not.

The biggest driver is my son, Arthur. The work is documentation, not for legacy, but for him. So he doesn't have to reverse-engineer how I survived. Everything I build now assumes he'll one day need to fork it and run.

## Conclusion

There's a part of me that welcomes the collapse, not emotionally or ideologically, but logically. Collapse enforces coherence. Those who built early will have leverage. Those who mocked preparation will have none. The timelines are converging.

Purpose is no longer about fulfilment. It's infrastructural. We need to build the economic floor for this new society, likely through an Automation Dividend or UBI, funded by the immense wealth AI will generate. This isn't a welfare payment; it's venture capital for the people, giving them the security to become creators.

I don't build to thrive in the old system. I build because the collapse has already happened, and someone still needs to pass the torch. That someone is Arthur. Everything else is optional.

If you're still operating under the assumption that things will stabilise, that "normal" is pending reversion, you're already obsolete.
