  "content": "Before my son was born, I thought I understood what it meant to care about something. I was wrong. Fatherhood has not merely added a new dimension to my life. It has revealed that what I previously thought of as the full range of human experience was only a fraction of what is possible.\n\nIf I were to put it simply: before Arthur, I operated on a scale of one to ten. After him, I discovered the scale goes to a thousand.\n\nHis first breath brought with it an immediate and overwhelming sense of responsibility. Not merely for the practical details of care, though those are considerable, but for the world into which he has arrived. And that world is stranger and more uncertain than any previous generation has inherited.\n\nMy son's early years coincide with what I believe historians will recognise as a turning point in human history: the emergence of genuine artificial intelligence. Not the narrow, task-specific tools that have existed for decades, but something qualitatively different. Systems that can reason, create, and adapt in ways that increasingly resemble human cognition.\n\nI have spent considerable time studying this technology, and I find myself caught between wonder and concern. The potential is genuinely extraordinary. Problems that have resisted solution for generations may yield to AI-accelerated research. The boundaries of what is possible are expanding in ways that would have seemed like fantasy just a few years ago.\n\nBut the transition will not be gentle. Our educational systems, our economic structures, our social arrangements, all were designed for a world that is rapidly ceasing to exist. The skills that guaranteed security for previous generations may prove worthless for my son's. The institutions that provided stability may not survive the transformation intact.\n\nI think about education constantly. The system that shaped my generation emphasised standardised outcomes, rigid structures, and skills that are now being automated at an accelerating rate. Memorisation, calculation, routine analysis, these were once valuable. They are becoming commodities.\n\nWhat cannot be automated, at least not yet, are the qualities that make us distinctly human. Creativity that springs from genuine understanding rather than pattern matching. Emotional intelligence that arises from lived experience. The capacity for empathy, for nuance, for the kind of wisdom that only emerges from wrestling with genuine uncertainty.\n\nThese are the qualities I hope to nurture in my son. Not as a defensive strategy against technological displacement, though they may serve that purpose, but because they represent the best of what human beings can be. The goal is not to compete with machines but to complement them, to find the forms of contribution that remain distinctly ours.\n\nThere is a paradox here that I find myself returning to often. Artificial intelligence, for all its cognitive power, forces us to reconsider what we truly value about human beings. In teaching machines to think, we are compelled to ask what thinking really means. In building systems that can process information with superhuman efficiency, we discover that information processing was never the point.\n\nThe economic implications trouble me deeply. Models built on endless consumption and abundant low-wage labour are becoming obsolete. When machines can produce material abundance, the distribution of that abundance becomes the central political question. I do not know what form the answer will take, perhaps some version of universal basic income, perhaps something we have not yet imagined, but I know that preparing my son means preparing him for a world where work means something very different than it does today.\n\nThe risks are real. Ethical frameworks lag behind technical capabilities. Regulatory environments struggle to keep pace. The concentration of power in a few hands raises questions that we have barely begun to address. My son's generation will inherit both the productive capacity of AI and the consequences of how we choose to deploy it.\n\nYet hope persists. Artificial intelligence could free human beings from drudgery, enabling richer and more intentional lives. It could accelerate scientific discovery, extend healthy lifespans, solve problems that have seemed intractable. I can imagine a future where my son uses these tools not as a replacement for human capability but as an extension of it, amplifying his creativity and expanding his reach.\n\nBecoming a father at this moment in history feels less like a personal choice and more like a profound responsibility. The decisions we make in the coming years will echo through generations. My son will live with the consequences long after I am gone.\n\nI cannot control the future. But I can try to prepare him for it, not by predicting what it will hold, but by nurturing the qualities that will serve him regardless of what comes. Adaptability. Curiosity. Compassion. The ability to find meaning in a world that will not stop changing.\n\nThis is the task of parenthood in an age of transformation. It is daunting, and I am not certain I am equal to it. But I am certain it is worth attempting."
