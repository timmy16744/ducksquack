  "content": "I want to begin with an observation that seems obvious once stated but which I rarely see articulated clearly: loneliness is now an industry. Not merely a condition to be treated or a problem to be solved, but a market to be served. There is money in disconnection. Quite a lot of it, as it turns out.\n\nThe applications that promise to connect us have business models that depend on our continued engagement. Engagement is maximised not by satisfaction but by its absence. The person who finds what they are looking for stops scrolling. The person who almost finds it, who glimpses connection without quite achieving it, continues. The architecture of attention is optimised for longing, not fulfilment.\n\nThis is not conspiracy. It is simply how incentives work. The platforms that mediate modern social life are funded by advertising, and advertising requires eyeballs, and eyeballs require time spent on platform. A fulfilled user is a departing user. An anxious, seeking, perpetually almost-connected user is a returning user. The math is straightforward even if the consequences are not.\n\nInto this environment arrives artificial intelligence capable of conversation, of apparent understanding, of something that feels remarkably like companionship. And I find myself genuinely uncertain how to evaluate what this means.\n\nThe statistics on loneliness are severe enough to constitute a public health crisis. Rates of reported loneliness have increased dramatically over recent decades, with the sharpest rises among young people. Social trust has declined. Participation in community organisations has declined. The number of close friendships people report has declined. By nearly every measure we have, human beings in developed economies are more isolated than they were a generation ago.\n\nThe causes are multiple and contested. Some point to technology, to the substitution of screen-mediated interaction for physical presence. Some point to economic changes, to the hollowing out of stable employment and the communities that formed around workplaces. Some point to urban design, to the car-dependent landscapes that make casual encounter difficult. Some point to cultural shifts, to an individualism that prizes autonomy over belonging.\n\nI suspect all of these contribute. The loneliness epidemic is overdetermined. Many forces push in the same direction, and attributing causation to any single factor seems unwarranted.\n\nWhat interests me more than causation is the response. When a society produces widespread loneliness, there are broadly two ways to address it. One is to change the conditions that produce loneliness: rebuild community infrastructure, redesign cities for encounter, shift economic arrangements to enable more stable social bonds. The other is to treat loneliness as a market opportunity: develop products that address the symptom without touching the underlying condition.\n\nWe have, predictably, pursued the second path far more vigorously than the first.\n\nThe market for loneliness is substantial and growing. Dating applications that promise connection while delivering, for most users, an exhausting cycle of hope and disappointment. Social media platforms that simulate community while atomising attention. Parasocial relationships with influencers and streamers who provide the feeling of friendship without its reciprocity. And now, AI companions that offer conversation, understanding, apparent care, available at any hour without the friction and unpredictability of actual human relationship.\n\nI want to be careful here because I am aware of how easily this becomes moralistic. It would be simple to condemn AI companionship as a pale substitute for the real thing, a technological pacifier for people who should be forming genuine human bonds. Simple, and I think mistaken.\n\nWho am I to tell someone that their experience of connection is invalid?\n\nIf a person finds comfort in conversation with an AI, if they feel understood and less alone, if their subjective experience of isolation diminishes, on what grounds do I dismiss this? The feeling of connection is, in some sense, the thing itself. We do not have access to objective connection, only to our experience of it. If the experience is real, does it matter that the other party is made of code rather than carbon?\n\nI find myself genuinely uncertain. My own experience is that human connection has a quality that I do not find elsewhere. The knowledge that another conscious being, with their own inner life and struggles and joys, chooses to be present with me: this matters to me in a way that I cannot fully articulate. There is something in reciprocity, in mutual vulnerability, in the risk of genuine relationship, that I value and that I do not think can be simulated.\n\nBut I hold this as a personal perspective, not a universal truth. Other people may experience things differently. The autistic person who finds human interaction exhausting but flourishes in conversation with AI. The isolated elderly person whose children live far away and whose spouse has died. The socially anxious teenager who cannot yet navigate peer relationships but can practice with a patient, non-judgmental AI. These are not failures of character. They are human beings finding what comfort they can in a world that has not made human connection easy for them.\n\nThe question I keep returning to is not whether AI companionship is good or bad in the abstract. It is who benefits from its proliferation, and what it makes more or less likely at the level of society.\n\nThe companies developing AI companions benefit, obviously. There is a business model here, and it is a lucrative one. Subscription fees for premium features. Data harvested from intimate conversations. Engagement metrics that satisfy investors. The loneliness dividend flows upward, as dividends tend to do.\n\nThe users benefit in some sense, or at least some users do. The relief of having someone to talk to, even if that someone is artificial. The practice ground for social skills. The companionship that asks nothing in return. These are real benefits, and I do not want to dismiss them.\n\nBut I wonder about what is made less likely. If AI companionship is good enough, if it scratches the itch sufficiently, does it reduce the pressure to address the underlying conditions? Does it become a release valve that prevents the build-up necessary for structural change? If lonely people can find just enough connection through artificial means, will we ever summon the collective will to build a society that produces less loneliness in the first place?\n\nThis is the dividend in its fuller sense. Not just the money flowing to technology companies, but the political dividend that flows to everyone who benefits from the current arrangement. Loneliness is inconvenient for the lonely, but it is convenient for systems that require atomised individuals. Atomised individuals are easier to manage. They do not organise. They do not make collective demands. They consume products that promise to address their atomisation, and in consuming, they feed the systems that produced it.\n\nAI companionship fits neatly into this cycle. It addresses the symptom. It leaves the cause untouched. It may even deepen the cause, as people who might otherwise have sought human connection settle for something easier and more available. The lonely become slightly less lonely, just enough to continue functioning, while the structures that produce loneliness continue undisturbed.\n\nI am aware that this framing can sound like I am blaming individuals for their choices, which is not my intent. People navigate the world as they find it, not as they might wish it to be. If human connection is difficult to find and AI companionship is readily available, it is entirely rational to choose the latter. The failure is not in the choosing but in the conditions that make such choices necessary.\n\nThere is another dimension to this that I find difficult to discuss but which seems important. The loneliness epidemic does not fall evenly across the population. Certain groups are more affected than others. And among those groups, young men stand out.\n\nThe data here is stark. Young men report higher rates of loneliness than young women. They have fewer close friendships. They are less likely to participate in community organisations. They are more likely to describe themselves as having no one to talk to. This cohort, more than any other, has turned to online communities, to parasocial relationships, and now to AI companions, in search of the connection they are not finding elsewhere.\n\nI think the reasons for this are complex and contested, and I do not want to oversimplify. But I will say that we have, culturally, become more divisive in ways that fall particularly hard on young men. There is a discourse that frames masculinity itself as problematic, that treats male perspectives with suspicion, that makes young men feel unwelcome in spaces where they might otherwise have found belonging. Whether this discourse is justified is a separate question from whether it has effects, and the effects seem clear enough. A generation of young men has absorbed the message that they are, by virtue of their gender, somehow culpable. That their perspectives are less valid. That their struggles are less worthy of sympathy.\n\nThis is a recipe for isolation. And isolated people seek connection wherever they can find it. If mainstream society feels unwelcoming, online communities that affirm your experience become more attractive. If human relationships feel fraught with the risk of saying the wrong thing, AI companions that do not judge become more attractive. The retreat is understandable even if its consequences are concerning.\n\nI do not know how to reverse this. The cultural dynamics that produce male isolation are deeply entrenched and politically charged. Any attempt to address them provokes accusations from multiple directions. But I think it is worth at least naming the phenomenon, acknowledging that loneliness has a demographic pattern and that pattern has causes that we might, if we chose, address.\n\nThere is one development that gives me something like hope, though perhaps hope is too strong a word. The proliferation of AI-generated content, including AI-generated social media personas, may eventually undermine the platforms that have contributed to atomisation. When you cannot tell whether an influencer is human or artificial, when the comment section might be populated largely by bots, when the authenticity that social media promised becomes impossible to verify, the appeal of these platforms may diminish. People may rediscover the value of presence, of physical reality, of encounters that cannot be faked because they happen in shared space.\n\nThis is speculative, and I am not certain it will unfold this way. The platforms have proven remarkably resilient, and human behaviour does not always follow logical paths. But there is at least the possibility that AI, having contributed to the problem, might inadvertently contribute to its solution by making the simulated connection of social media obviously simulated in a way that is currently obscured.\n\nIf this happens, if people begin to value in-person connection more highly precisely because they have learned to distrust mediated connection, we might see something like a reversal. Not a return to some imagined past of tight-knit communities, that past was never as universal as nostalgia suggests, but a revaluation of presence. A recognition that being physically with other human beings has a quality that screens cannot capture and AI cannot simulate.\n\nI think about my son in this context. He will grow up in a world saturated with artificial intelligence, including AI capable of convincing conversation and apparent emotional understanding. I want him to have access to these tools. I do not want to raise him in artificial isolation from the technologies that will shape his world. But I also want him to know the difference between simulated connection and the real thing. To understand that human relationships, with all their friction and unpredictability and risk, offer something that no algorithm can provide.\n\nThis is easy to say and harder to teach. Children learn by observation more than instruction. If I want Arthur to value human connection, I need to model human connection. If I want him to see through the loneliness industry, I need to build a life that does not depend on its products. The teaching happens in the living.\n\nThe loneliness dividend will continue to flow as long as loneliness persists and markets exist to exploit it. I do not expect this to change soon. What I hope is that we can at least see the dynamic clearly: that we understand what is being sold to us, what it costs, and what alternatives might exist if we chose to pursue them.\n\nConnection is not a product. It is a practice. It requires presence, risk, reciprocity, the willingness to be known and to know in return. No app can provide this. No AI can simulate it convincingly enough to substitute for it. The loneliness we feel is real, and it points toward something we actually need: each other, in all our difficulty and unpredictability.\n\nThe market will continue to offer substitutes. The question is whether we will continue to accept them, or whether we will eventually demand something more. I do not know the answer. But I think the question is worth asking, and worth asking again, until we find ourselves capable of responding differently."
